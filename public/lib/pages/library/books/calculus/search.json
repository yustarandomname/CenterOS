","xi The art of teaching, Mark Van Doren said, is the art of assisting discovery. I have tried to write a book that assists students in discovering calculus—both for its practical power and its surprising beauty. In this edition, as in the first seven editions, I aim to convey to the student a sense of the utility of calculus and develop technical competence, but I also strive to give some appreciation for the intrinsic beauty of the subject. Newton undoubtedly experienced a sense of triumph when he made his great discoveries. I want students to share some of that excitement. The emphasis is on understanding concepts. I think that nearly everybody agrees that this should be the primary goal of calculus instruction. In fact, the impetus for the cur-rent calculus reform movement came from the Tulane Conference in 1986, which for-mulated as their first recommendation: Focus on conceptual understanding. I have tried to implement this goal through the Rule of Three: “Topics should be pre-sented geometrically, numerically, and algebraically.” Visualization, numerical and graphical experimentation, and other approaches have changed how we teach concep-tual reasoning in fundamental ways. More recently, the Rule of Three has been expanded to become the Rule of Four by emphasizing the verbal, or descriptive, point of view as well. In writing the eighth edition my premise has been that it is possible to achieve con-ceptual understanding and still retain the best traditions of traditional calculus. The book contains elements of reform, but within the context of a traditional curriculum. I have written several other calculus textbooks that might be preferable for some instruc-tors. Most of them also come in single variable and multivariable versions. ● Calculus, Eighth Edition, is similar to the present textbook except that the exponen-tial, logarithmic, and inverse trigonometric functions are covered in the second semester. ● Essential Calculus , Second Edition, is a much briefer book (840 pages), though it contains almost all of the topics in Calculus, Eighth Edition. The relative brevity is achieved through briefer exposition of some topics and putting some features on the website. ● Essential Calculus: Early Transcendentals, Second Edition, resembles Essential Calculus, but the exponential, logarithmic, and inverse trigonometric functions are covered in Chapter 3. A great discovery solves a great problem but there is a grain of discovery in the solution of any problem. Your problem may be modest; but if it challenges your curiosity and brings into play your inventive faculties, and if you solve it by your own means, you may experience the tension and enjoy the triumph of discovery.

","xii Preface ● Calculus: Concepts and Contexts , Fourth Edition, emphasizes conceptual under-standing even more strongly than this book. The coverage of topics is not encyclo-pedic and the material on transcendental functions and on parametric equations is woven throughout the book instead of being treated in separate chapters. ● Calculus: Early Vectors introduces vectors and vector functions in the first semester and integrates them throughout the book. It is suitable for students taking engineer-ing and physics courses concurrently with calculus. ● Brief Applied Calculus is intended for students in business, the social sciences, and the life sciences. ● Biocalculus: Calculus for the Life Sciences is intended to show students in the life sciences how calculus relates to biology. ● Biocalculus: Calculus, Probability, and Statistics for the Life Sciences contains all the content of Biocalculus: Calculus for the Life Sciences as well as three addi-tional chapters covering probability and statistics. The changes have resulted from talking with my colleagues and students at the Univer-sity of Toronto and from reading journals, as well as suggestions from users and review-ers. Here are some of the many improvements that I’ve incorporated into this edition: ● The data in examples and exercises have been updated to be more timely. ● New examples have been added (see Examples 6.1.5, 11.2.5, and 14.3.3, for instance). And the solutions to some of the existing examples have been amplified. ● Three new projects have been added: The project Controlling Red Blood Cell Loss During Surgery (page 244) describes the ANH procedure, in which blood is extracted from the patient before an operation and is replaced by saline solution. This dilutes the patient’s blood so that fewer red blood cells are lost during bleed-ing and the extracted blood is returned to the patient after surgery. The project Planes and Birds: Minimizing Energy (page 344) asks how birds can minimize power and energy by flapping their wings versus gliding. In the project The Speedo LZR Racer (page 936) it is explained that this suit reduces drag in the water and, as a result, many swimming records were broken. Students are asked why a small decrease in drag can have a big effect on performance. ● I have streamlined Chapter 15 (Multiple Integrals) by combining the first two sec-tions so that iterated integrals are treated earlier. ● More than 20% of the exercises in each chapter are new. Here are some of my favorites: 2.7.61, 2.8.36–38, 3.1.79–80, 3.11.54, 4.1.69, 4.3.34, 4.3.66, 4.4.80, 4.7.39, 4.7.67, 5.1.19–20, 5.2.67–68, 5.4.70, 6.1.51, 8.1.39, 12.5.81, 12.6.29–30, 14.6.65–66. In addition, there are some good new Problems Plus. (See Problems 12–14 on page 272, Problem 13 on page 363, Problems 16–17 on page 426, and Problem 8 on page 986.) Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","Preface xiii Conceptual Exercises The most important way to foster conceptual understanding is through the problems that we assign. To that end I have devised various types of problems. Some exercise sets begin with requests to explain the meanings of the basic concepts of the section. (See, for instance, the irst few exercises in Sections 2.2, 2.5, 11.2, 14.2, and 14.3.) Similarly, all the review sections begin with a Concept Check and a True-False Quiz. Other exercises test conceptual understanding through graphs or tables (see Exercises 2.7.17, 2.8.35–38, 2.8.47–52, 9.1.11–13, 10.1.24–27, 11.10.2, 13.2.1–2, 13.3.33–39, 14.1.1–2, 14.1.32–38, 14.1.41–44, 14.3.3–10, 14.6.1–2, 14.7.3–4, 15.1.6–8, 16.1.11–18, 16.2.17–18, and 16.3.1–2). Another type of exercise uses verbal description to test conceptual understanding (see Exercises 2.5.10, 2.8.66, 4.3.69–70, and 7.8.67). I particularly value problems that combine and compare graphical, numerical, and algebraic approaches (see Exercises 2.6.45–46, 3.7.27, and 9.4.4). Graded Exercise Sets Each exercise set is carefully graded, progressing from basic conceptual exercises and skill-development problems to more challenging problems involving applications and proofs. Real-World Data My assistants and I spent a great deal of time looking in libraries, contacting companies and government agencies, and searching the Internet for interesting real-world data to introduce, motivate, and illustrate the concepts of calculus. As a result, many of the examples and exercises deal with functions deined by such numerical data or graphs. See, for instance, Figure 1 in Section 1.1 (seismograms from the Northridge earthquake), Exercise 2.8.35 (unemployment rates), Exercise 5.1.16 (velocity of the space shuttle Endeavour ), and Figure 4 in Section 5.4 (San Francisco power consumption). Functions of two variables are illustrated by a table of values of the wind-chill index as a function of air temperature and wind speed (Example 14.1.2). Partial derivatives are introduced in Section 14.3 by examining a column in a table of values of the heat index (perceived air temperature) as a function of the actual temperature and the relative humidity. This example is pursued further in connection with linear approximations (Example 14.4.3). Directional derivatives are introduced in Section 14.6 by using a temperature contour map to estimate the rate of change of temperature at Reno in the direction of Las Vegas. Double integrals are used to estimate the average snowfall in Colorado on December 20–21, 2006 (Example 15.1.9). Vector ields are introduced in Section 16.1 by depictions of actual velocity vector ields showing San Francisco Bay wind patterns. Projects One way of involving students and making them active learners is to have them work (perhaps in groups) on extended projects that give a feeling of substantial accomplish-ment when completed. I have included four kinds of projects: Applied Projects involve applications that are designed to appeal to the imagination of students. The project after Section 9.3 asks whether a ball thrown upward takes longer to reach its maximum height or to fall back to its original height. (The answer might surprise you.) The project after Section 14.8 uses Lagrange multipliers to determine the masses of the three stages of a rocket so as to minimize the total mass while enabling the rocket to reach a desired Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Laboratory Projects involve technology; the one following Section 10.2 shows how to use Bézier curves to design shapes that represent letters for a laser printer. Writ-ing Projects ask students to compare present-day methods with those of the founders of calculus—Fermat’s method for inding tangents, for instance. Suggested references are supplied. Discovery Projects anticipate results to be discussed later or encourage dis-covery through pattern recognition (see the one following Section 7.6). Others explore aspects of geometry: tetrahedra (after Section 12.4), hyperspheres (after Section 15.6), and intersections of three cylinders (after Section 15.7). Additional projects can be found in the Instructor’s Guide (see, for instance, Group Exercise 5.1: Position from Samples). Problem Solving Students usually have dificulties with problems for which there is no single well-deined procedure for obtaining the answer. I think nobody has improved very much on George Polya’s four-stage problem-solving strategy and, accordingly, I have included a version of his problem-solving principles following Chapter 1. They are applied, both explicitly and implicitly, throughout the book. After the other chapters I have placed sections called Problems Plus , which feature examples of how to tackle challenging calculus problems. In selecting the varied problems for these sections I kept in mind the following advice from David Hilbert: “A mathematical problem should be dificult in order to entice us, yet not inaccessible lest it mock our efforts.” When I put these challenging problems on assignments and tests I grade them in a different way. Here I reward a student signii-cantly for ideas toward a solution and for recognizing which problem-solving principles are relevant. Technology The availability of technology makes it not less important but more important to clearly understand the concepts that underlie the images on the screen. But, when properly used, graphing calculators and computers are powerful tools for discovering and understand-ing those concepts. This textbook can be used either with or without technology and I use two special symbols to indicate clearly when a particular type of machine is required. The icon ; indicates an exercise that deinitely requires the use of such technology, but that is not to say that it can’t be used on the other exercises as well. The symbol CAS is reserved for problems in which the full resources of a computer algebra system (like Maple, Mathematica, or the TI-89) are required. But technology doesn’t make pencil and paper obsolete. Hand calculation and sketches are often preferable to technology for illustrating and reinforcing some concepts. Both instructors and students need to develop the ability to decide where the hand or the machine is appropriate. Tools for Enriching Calculus TEC is a companion to the text and is intended to enrich and complement its contents. (It is now accessible in the eBook via CourseMate and Enhanced WebAssign. Selected Visuals and Modules are available at www.stewartcalculus.com.) Developed by Harvey Keynes, Dan Clegg, Hubert Hohn, and myself, TEC uses a discovery and exploratory approach. In sections of the book where technology is particularly appropriate, marginal icons direct students to TEC Modules that provide a laboratory environment in which they can explore the topic in different ways and at different levels. Visuals are anima-tions of igures in text; Modules are more elaborate activities and include exercises . Instructors can choose to become involved at several different levels, ranging from sim-ply encouraging students to use the Visuals and Modules for independent exploration, to assigning speciic exercises from those included with each Module, or to creating additional exercises, labs, and projects that make use of the Visuals and Modules.

","Preface xv TEC also includes Homework Hints for representative exercises (usually odd-num-bered) in every section of the text, indicated by printing the exercise number in red. These hints are usually presented in the form of questions and try to imitate an effective teaching assistant by functioning as a silent tutor. They are constructed so as not to reveal any more of the actual solution than is minimally necessary to make further progress. Enhanced WebAssign Technology is having an impact on the way homework is assigned to students, particu-larly in large classes. The use of online homework is growing and its appeal depends on ease of use, grading precision, and reliability. With the Eighth Edition we have been working with the calculus community and WebAssign to develop an online homework system. Up to 70% of the exercises in each section are assignable as online homework, including free response, multiple choice, and multi-part formats. The system also includes Active Examples, in which students are guided in step-by-step tutorials through text examples, with links to the textbook and to video solutions.

This is an overview of the subject and includes a list of questions to motivate the study of calculus. From the beginning, multiple representations of functions are stressed: verbal, numeri-cal, visual, and algebraic. A discussion of mathematical models leads to a review of the standard functions, including exponential and logarithmic functions, from these four points of view. The material on limits is motivated by a prior discussion of the tangent and velocity problems. Limits are treated from descriptive, graphical, numerical, and algebraic points of view. Section 2.4, on the precise definition of a limit, is an optional section.

","xvi Preface 2.7 and 2.8 deal with derivatives (especially with functions defined graphically and numerically) before the differentiation rules are covered in Chapter 3. Here the exam-ples and exercises explore the meanings of derivatives in various contexts. Higher deriva-tives are introduced in Section 2.8. All the basic functions, including exponential, logarithmic, and inverse trigonometric functions, are differentiated here. When derivatives are computed in applied situations, students are asked to explain their meanings. Exponential growth and decay are now covered in this chapter. The basic facts concerning extreme values and shapes of curves are deduced from the Mean Value Theorem. Graphing with technology emphasizes the interaction between calculus and calculators and the analysis of families of curves. Some substantial optimi-zation problems are provided, including an explanation of why you need to raise your head 42° to see the top of a rainbow. The area problem and the distance problem serve to motivate the definite integral, with sigma notation introduced as needed. (Full coverage of sigma notation is provided in Appendix E.) Emphasis is placed on explaining the meanings of integrals in various contexts and on estimating their values from graphs and tables. Here I present the applications of integration—area, volume, work, average value—that can reasonably be done without specialized techniques of integration. General methods are emphasized. The goal is for students to be able to divide a quantity into small pieces, estimate with Riemann sums, and recognize the limit as an integral. All the standard methods are covered but, of course, the real challenge is to be able to recognize which technique is best used in a given situation. Accordingly, in Section 7.5, I present a strategy for integration. The use of computer algebra systems is discussed in Section 7.6. Here are the applications of integration—arc length and surface area—for which it is useful to have available all the techniques of integration, as well as applications to biol-ogy, economics, and physics (hydrostatic force and centers of mass). I have also included a section on probability. There are more applications here than can realistically be covered in a given course. Instructors should select applications suitable for their students and for which they themselves have enthusiasm. Modeling is the theme that unifies this introductory treatment of differential equations. Direction fields and Euler’s method are studied before separable and linear equations are solved explicitly, so that qualitative, numerical, and analytic approaches are given equal consideration. These methods are applied to the exponential, logistic, and other models for population growth. The first four or five sections of this chapter serve as a good introduction to first-order differential equations. An optional final section uses predator-prey models to illustrate systems of differential equations. This chapter introduces parametric and polar curves and applies the methods of calculus to them. Parametric curves are well suited to laboratory projects; the two presented here involve families of curves and Bézier curves. A brief treatment of conic sections in polar coordinates prepares the way for Kepler’s Laws in Chapter 13. 3 Diferentiation Rules 4 Applications of Diferentiation 5 Integrals 6 Applications of Integration 7 Techniques of Integration 8 Further Applications of Integration 9 Diferential Equations 10 Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","Preface xvii The convergence tests have intuitive justifications (see page 719) as well as formal proofs. Numerical estimates of sums of series are based on which test was used to prove convergence. The emphasis is on Taylor series and polynomials and their applications to physics. Error estimates include those from graphing devices. The material on three-dimensional analytic geometry and vectors is divided into two chapters. Chapter 12 deals with vectors, the dot and cross products, lines, planes, and surfaces. This chapter covers vector-valued functions, their derivatives and integrals, the length and curvature of space curves, and velocity and acceleration along space curves, culmi-nating in Kepler’s laws. Functions of two or more variables are studied from verbal, numerical, visual, and alge-braic points of view. In particular, I introduce partial derivatives by looking at a specific column in a table of values of the heat index (perceived air temperature) as a function of the actual temperature and the relative humidity. Contour maps and the Midpoint Rule are used to estimate the average snowfall and average temperature in given regions. Double and triple integrals are used to compute probabilities, surface areas, and (in projects) volumes of hyperspheres and volumes of intersections of three cylinders. Cylindrical and spherical coordinates are introduced in the context of evaluating triple integrals. Vector fields are introduced through pictures of velocity fields showing San Francisco Bay wind patterns. The similarities among the Fundamental Theorem for line integrals, Green’s Theorem, Stokes’ Theorem, and the Divergence Theorem are emphasized. Since first-order differential equations are covered in Chapter 9, this final chapter deals with second-order linear differential equations, their application to vibrating springs and electric circuits, and series solutions. Calculus, Early Transcendentals , Eighth Edition, is supported by a complete set of ancillaries developed under my direction. Each piece has been designed to enhance student understanding and to facilitate creative instruction. The tables on pages xxi–xxii describe each of these ancillaries. The preparation of this and previous editions has involved much time spent reading the reasoned (but sometimes contradictory) advice from a large number of astute reviewers. I greatly appreciate the time they spent to understand my motivation for the approach taken. I have learned something from each of them.

","xxiii To the Student Reading a calculus textbook is different from reading a newspaper or a novel, or even a physics book. Don’t be dis-couraged if you have to read a passage more than once in order to understand it. You should have pencil and paper and calculator at hand to sketch a diagram or make a calculation. Some students start by trying their homework problems and read the text only if they get stuck on an exercise. I sug-gest that a far better plan is to read and understand a section of the text before attempting the exercises. In particular, you should look at the definitions to see the exact meanings of the terms. And before you read each example, I suggest that you cover up the solution and try solving the problem your-self. You’ll get a lot more from looking at the solution if you do so. Part of the aim of this course is to train you to think logi-cally. Learn to write the solutions of the exercises in a con-nected, step-by-step fashion with explanatory sentences— not just a string of disconnected equations or formulas. The answers to the odd-numbered exercises appear at the back of the book, in Appendix I. Some exercises ask for a verbal explanation or interpretation or description. In such cases there is no single correct way of expressing the answer, so don’t worry that you haven’t found the definitive answer. In addition, there are often several different forms in which to express a numerical or algebraic answer, so if your answer differs from mine, don’t immediately assume you’re wrong. For example, if the answer given in the back of the book is s 2 2 1 and you obtain 1 y ( 1 1 s 2 ) , then you’re right and rationalizing the denominator will show that the answers are equivalent. The icon ; indicates an exercise that definitely requires the use of either a graphing calculator or a computer with graphing software. But that doesn’t mean that graphing devices can’t be used to check your work on the other exer-cises as well. The symbol CAS is reserved for problems in which the full resources of a computer algebra system (like Maple, Mathematica, or the TI-89) are required. You will also encounter the symbol | , which warns you against committing an error. I have placed this symbol in the margin in situations where I have observed that a large proportion of my students tend to make the same mistake. Tools for Enriching Calculus , which is a companion to this text, is referred to by means of the symbol TEC and can be accessed in the eBook via Enhanced WebAssign and CourseMate (selected Visuals and Modules are available at www.stewartcalculus.com). It directs you to modules in which you can explore aspects of calculus for which the computer is particularly useful. You will notice that some exercise numbers are printed in red: 5. This indicates that Homework Hints are available for the exercise. These hints can be found on stewartcalcu-lus.com as well as Enhanced WebAssign and CourseMate. The homework hints ask you questions that allow you to make progress toward a solution without actually giving you the answer. You need to pursue each hint in an active manner with pencil and paper to work out the details. If a particular hint doesn’t enable you to solve the problem, you can click to reveal the next hint. I recommend that you keep this book for reference pur-poses after you finish the course. Because you will likely forget some of the specific details of calculus, the book will serve as a useful reminder when you need to use calculus in subsequent courses. And, because this book contains more material than can be covered in any one course, it can also serve as a valuable resource for a working scientist or engineer. Calculus is an exciting subject, justly considered to be one of the greatest achievements of the human intellect. I hope you will discover that it is not only useful but also intrinsically beautiful.

","xxiv Advances in technology continue to bring a wider variety of tools for doing mathematics. Handheld calculators are becoming more pow-erful, as are software programs and Internet resources. In addition, many mathematical applications have been released for smartphones and tablets such as the iPad. Some exercises in this text are marked with a graphing icon ; , which indicates that the use of some technology is required. Often this means that we intend for a graphing device to be used in drawing the graph of a function or equation. You might also need technology to ind the zeros of a graph or the points of intersection of two graphs. In some cases we will use a calculating device to solve an equation or evaluate a deinite integral numerically. Many scientiic and graphing calculators have these features built in, such as the Texas Instruments TI-84 or TI-Nspire CX. Similar calculators are made by Hewlett Pack-ard, Casio, and Sharp. © Dan Clegg © Dan Clegg You can also use computer software such as Graphing Calculator by Paciic Tech (www.paciict.com) to perform many of these functions, as well as apps for phones and tablets, like Quick Graph (Colombiamug) or Math-Studio (Pomegranate Apps).

","xxv © Dan Clegg The CAS icon is reserved for problems in which the full resources of a computer algebra system (CAS) are required. A CAS is capable of doing mathematics (like solving equations, computing derivatives or integrals) symbolically rather than just numerically. Examples of well-established computer algebra systems are the com-puter software packages Maple and Mathematica. The WolframAlpha website uses the Mathematica engine to provide CAS functionality via the Web. Many handheld graphing calculators have CAS capabilities, such as the TI-89 and TI-Nspire CX CAS from Texas Instruments. Some tablet and smartphone apps also provide these capabilities, such as the previously mentioned MathStudio. In general, when we use the term “calculator” in this book, we mean the use of any of the resources we have mentioned. © Dan Clegg © Dan Clegg Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

A Preview of Calculus CALCULUS IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM the mathematics that you have studied previ-ously: calculus is less static and more dynamic. It is concerned with change and motion; it deals with quantities that approach other quantities. For that reason it may be useful to have an overview of the subject before beginning its intensive study. Here we give a glimpse of some of the main ideas of calculus by showing how the concept of a limit arises when we attempt to solve a variety of problems. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","2 A PREVIEW OF CALCULUS The Area Problem The origins of calculus go back at least 2500 years to the ancient Greeks, who found areas using the “method of exhaustion.” They knew how to ind the area A of any poly-gon by dividing it into triangles as in Figure 1 and adding the areas of these triangles. It is a much more dificult problem to ind the area of a curved igure. The Greek method of exhaustion was to inscribe polygons in the igure and circumscribe polygons about the igure and then let the number of sides of the polygons increase. Figure 2 illus-trates this process for the special case of a circle with inscribed regular polygons. A¡™ H11080H11080H11080 A¶ H11080H11080H11080 Aß A∞ A¢ A£ Let A n be the area of the inscribed polygon with n sides. As n increases, it appears that A n becomes closer and closer to the area of the circle. We say that the area of the circle is the limit of the areas of the inscribed polygons, and we write A -lim n l ` A n The Greeks themselves did not use limits explicitly. However, by indirect reasoning, Eudoxus (i fth century bc) used exhaustion to prove the familiar formula for the area of a circle: A -H9266 r 2 . We will use a similar idea in Chapter 5 to ind areas of regions of the type shown in Figure 3. We will approximate the desired area A by areas of rectangles (as in Figure 4), let the width of the rectangles decrease, and then calculate A as the limit of these sums of areas of rectangles. 1 n 1 0 x y (1, 1) 1 0 x y (1, 1) 1 4 1 2 3 4 0 x y 1 (1, 1) 1 0 x y y=≈ A (1, 1) The area problem is the central problem in the branch of calculus called integral cal-culus . The techniques that we will develop in Chapter 5 for inding areas will also enable us to compute the volume of a solid, the length of a curve, the force of water against a dam, the mass and center of gravity of a rod, and the work done in pumping water out of a tank. The Tangent Problem Consider the problem of trying to ind an equation of the tangent line t to a curve with equation y -f s x d at a given point P .

For now you can think of it as a line that touches the curve at P as in Figure 5.) Since we know that the point P lies on the tangent line, we can ind the equation of t if we know its slope m . The problem is that we need two points to compute the slope and we know only one point, P , on t . To get around the problem we irst ind an approximation to m by taking a nearby point Q on the curve and computing the slope m PQ of the secant line PQ . From Figure 6 we see that 1 m PQ -f s x d 2 f s a d x 2 a Now imagine that Q moves along the curve toward P as in Figure 7. You can see that the secant line rotates and approaches the tangent line as its limiting position. This means that the slope m PQ of the secant line becomes closer and closer to the slope m of the tan-gent line. We write m -lim Q l P m PQ and we say that m is the limit of m PQ as Q approaches P along the curve. Because x approaches a as Q approaches P , we could also use Equation 1 to write 2 m -lim x l a f s x d 2 f s a d x 2 a Speciic examples of this procedure will be given in Chapter 2. The tangent problem has given rise to the branch of calculus called differential calcu- lus, which was not invented until more than 2000 years after integral calculus. The main ideas behind differential calculus are due to the French mathematician Pierre Fer-mat (1601–1665) and were developed by the English mathematicians John Wallis (1616–1703), Isaac Barrow (1630–1677), and Isaac Newton (1642–1727) and the Ger-man mathematician Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716). The two branches of calculus and their chief problems, the area problem and the tan-gent problem, appear to be very different, but it turns out that there is a very close con-nection between them. The tangent problem and the area problem are inverse problems in a sense that will be described in Chapter 5. Velocity When we look at the speedometer of a car and read that the car is traveling at 48 mi y h, what does that information indicate to us? We know that if the velocity remains constant, then after an hour we will have traveled 48 mi. But if the velocity of the car varies, what does it mean to say that the velocity at a given instant is 48 mi y h? In order to analyze this question, let’s examine the motion of a car that travels along a straight road and assume that we can measure the distance traveled by the car (in feet) at l-second intervals as in the following chart: t -Time elapsed s s d 0 1 2 3 4 5 d -Distance s ft d 0 2 9 24 42 71 0 y x P y=ƒ t P Q t 0 x y y 0 x a x ƒ-f(a) P{a, f(a)} x-a t Q{x, ƒ} FIGURE 5 The tangent line at P FIGURE 6 The secant line at PQ FIGURE 7 Secant lines approaching the tangent line A PREVIEW OF CALCULUS 3 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","4 A PREVIEW OF CALCULUS As a irst step toward inding the velocity after 2 seconds have elapsed, we ind the aver-age velocity during the time interval 2 < t < 4: average velocity -change in position time elapsed -42 2 9 4 2 2 -16.5 ft y s Similarly, the average velocity in the time interval 2 < t < 3 is average velocity -24 2 9 3 2 2 -15 ft y s We have the feeling that the velocity at the instant t -2 can’t be much different from the average velocity during a short time interval starting at t -2. So let’s imagine that the dis- tance traveled has been measured at 0.l-second time intervals as in the following chart: t 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 d 9.00 10.02 11.16 12.45 13.96 15.80 Then we can compute, for instance, the average velocity over the time interval f 2, 2.5 g : average velocity -15.80 2 9.00 2.5 2 2 -13.6 ft y s The results of such calculations are shown in the following chart: Time interval f 2, 3 g f 2, 2.5 g f 2, 2.4 g f 2, 2.3 g f 2, 2.2 g f 2, 2.1 g Average velocity s ft y s d 15.0 13.6 12.4 11.5 10.8 10.2 The average velocities over successively smaller intervals appear to be getting closer to a number near 10, and so we expect that the velocity at exactly t -2 is about 10 ft y s. In Chapter 2 we will deine the instantaneous velocity of a moving object as the limiting value of the average velocities over smaller and smaller time intervals. In Figure 8 we show a graphical representation of the motion of the car by plotting the distance traveled as a function of time. If we write d -f s t d , then f s t d is the number of feet traveled after t seconds. The average velocity in the time interval f 2, t g is average velocity -change in position time elapsed -f s t d 2 f s 2 d t 2 2 which is the same as the slope of the secant line PQ in Figure 8. The velocity v when t -2 is the limiting value of this average velocity as t approaches 2; that is, v -lim t l 2 f s t d 2 f s 2 d t 2 2 and we recognize from Equation 2 that this is the same as the slope of the tangent line to the curve at P . t d 0 1 2 3 4 5 10 20 P{2, f(2)} Q{ t, f(t)} FIGURE 8 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","A PREVIEW OF CALCULUS 5 Thus, when we solve the tangent problem in differential calculus, we are also solving problems concerning velocities. The same techniques also enable us to solve problems involving rates of change in all of the natural and social sciences. The Limit of a Sequence In the ifth century bc the Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea posed four problems, now known as Zeno’s paradoxes , that were intended to challenge some of the ideas concerning space and time that were held in his day. Zeno’s second paradox concerns a race between the Greek hero Achilles and a tortoise that has been given a head start. Zeno argued, as fol- lows, that Achilles could never pass the tortoise: Suppose that Achilles starts at position a 1 and the tortoise starts at position t 1 . (See Figure 9.) When Achilles reaches the point a 2 -t 1 , the tortoise is farther ahead at position t 2 . When Achilles reaches a 3 -t 2 , the tor- toise is at t 3 . This process continues indeinitely and so it appears that the tortoise will always be ahead! But this deies common sense. Achilles tortoise a¡ a™ a£ a¢ a∞ t¡ t™ t£ t¢ . . . . . . One way of explaining this paradox is with the idea of a sequence . The successive posi-tions of Achilles s a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , . . . d or the successive positions of the tortoise s t 1 , t 2 , t 3 , . . . d form what is known as a sequence. In general, a sequence h a n j is a set of numbers written in a deinite order. For instance, the sequence h 1, 1 2 , 1 3 , 1 4 , 1 5 , . . . j can be described by giving the following formula for the n th term: a n -1 n We can visualize this sequence by plotting its terms on a number line as in Fig- ure 10(a) or by drawing its graph as in Figure 10(b). Observe from either picture that the terms of the sequence a n -1 y n are becoming closer and closer to 0 as n increases. In fact, we can ind terms as small as we please by making n large enough. We say that the limit of the sequence is 0, and we indicate this by writing lim n l ` 1 n -0 In general, the notation lim n l ` a n -L is used if the terms a n approach the number L as n becomes large. This means that the num- bers a n can be made as close as we like to the number L by taking n suficiently large.

","6 A PREVIEW OF CALCULUS The concept of the limit of a sequence occurs whenever we use the decimal represen-tation of a real number. For instance, if a 1 -3.1 a 2 -3.14 a 3 -3.141 a 4 -3.1415 a 5 -3.14159 a 6 -3.141592 a 7 -3.1415926 f then lim n l ` a n -H9266 The terms in this sequence are rational approximations to H9266 . Let’s return to Zeno’s paradox. The successive positions of Achilles and the tortoise form sequences h a n j and h t n j , where a n , t n for all n . It can be shown that both sequences have the same limit: lim n l ` a n -p -lim n l ` t n It is precisely at this point p that Achilles overtakes the tortoise. The Sum of a Series Another of Zeno’s paradoxes, as passed on to us by Aristotle, is the following: “A man standing in a room cannot walk to the wall. In order to do so, he would irst have to go half the distance, then half the remaining distance, and then again half of what still remains. This process can always be continued and can never be ended.” (See Figure 11.) 1 2 1 4 1 8 1 16 Of course, we know that the man can actually reach the wall, so this suggests that per-haps the total distance can be expressed as the sum of ininitely many smaller distances as follows: 3 1 -1 2 1 1 4 1 1 8 1 1 16 1 ∙∙∙ 1 1 2 n 1 ∙∙∙ FIGURE 11 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","A PREVIEW OF CALCULUS 7 Zeno was arguing that it doesn’t make sense to add ininitely many numbers together. But there are other situations in which we implicitly use ininite sums. For instance, in decimal notation, the symbol 0.3 -0.3333 . . . means 3 10 1 3 100 1 3 1000 1 3 10,000 1 ∙∙∙ and so, in some sense, it must be true that 3 10 1 3 100 1 3 1000 1 3 10,000 1 ∙∙∙ -1 3 More generally, if d n denotes the n th digit in the decimal representation of a number, then 0. d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 ... -d 1 10 1 d 2 10 2 1 d 3 10 3 1 ∙∙∙ 1 d n 10 n 1 ∙∙∙ Therefore some ininite sums, or ininite series as they are called, have a meaning. But we must deine carefully what the sum of an ininite series is. Returning to the series in Equation 3, we denote by s n the sum of the irst n terms of the series. Thus s 1 -1 2 -0.5 s 2 -1 2 1 1 4 -0.75 s 3 -1 2 1 1 4 1 1 8 -0.875 s 4 -1 2 1 1 4 1 1 8 1 1 16 -0.9375 s 5 -1 2 1 1 4 1 1 8 1 1 16 1 1 32 -0.96875 s 6 -1 2 1 1 4 1 1 8 1 1 16 1 1 32 1 1 64 -0.984375 s 7 -1 2 1 1 4 1 1 8 1 1 16 1 1 32 1 1 64 1 1 128 -0.9921875 f s 10 -1 2 1 1 4 1 ∙∙∙ 1 1 1024 < 0.99902344 f s 16 -1 2 1 1 4 1 ∙∙∙ 1 1 2 16 < 0.99998474 Observe that as we add more and more terms, the partial sums become closer and closer to 1. In fact, it can be shown that by taking n large enough (that is, by adding suficiently many terms of the series), we can make the partial sum s n as close as we please to the num- ber 1. It therefore seems reasonable to say that the sum of the ininite series is 1 and to write 1 2 1 1 4 1 1 8 1 ∙∙∙ 1 1 2 n 1 ∙∙∙ -1 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

","8 A PREVIEW OF CALCULUS In other words, the reason the sum of the series is 1 is that lim n l ` s n -1 In Chapter 11 we will discuss these ideas further. We will then use Newton’s idea of combining ininite series with differential and integral calculus. Summary We have seen that the concept of a limit arises in trying to ind the area of a region, the slope of a tangent to a curve, the velocity of a car, or the sum of an ininite series. In each case the common theme is the calculation of a quantity as the limit of other, easily calculated quantities. It is this basic idea of a limit that sets calculus apart from other areas of mathematics. In fact, we could deine calculus as the part of mathematics that deals with limits. After Sir Isaac Newton invented his version of calculus, he used it to explain the motion of the planets around the sun. Today calculus is used in calculating the orbits of satellites and spacecraft, in predicting population sizes, in estimating how fast oil prices rise or fall, in forecasting weather, in measuring the cardiac output of the heart, in cal-culating life insurance premiums, and in a great variety of other areas. We will explore some of these uses of calculus in this book. In order to convey a sense of the power of the subject, we end this preview with a list of some of the questions that you will be able to answer using calculus: 1. How can we explain the fact, illustrated in Figure 12, that the angle of elevation from an observer up to the highest point in a rainbow is 42°? (See page 285.) 2. How can we explain the shapes of cans on supermarket shelves? (See page 343.) 3. Where is the best place to sit in a movie theater? (See page 465.) 4. How can we design a roller coaster for a smooth ride? (See page 182.) 5. How far away from an airport should a pilot start descent? (See page 208.) 6. How can we it curves together to design shapes to represent letters on a laser printer? (See page 657.) 7. How can we estimate the number of workers that were needed to build the Great Pyramid of Khufu in ancient Egypt? (See page 460.) 8. Where should an inielder position himself to catch a baseball thrown by an outielder and relay it to home plate? (See page 465.) 9. Does a ball thrown upward take longer to reach its maximum height or to fall back to its original height? (See page 609.) 10. How can we explain the fact that planets and satellites move in elliptical orbits? (See page 868.) 11. How can we distribute w ater low among turbines at a hydroelectric station so as to maximize the total energy production? (See page 980.) 12.

","9 Often a graph is the best way to represent a function because it conveys so much information at a glance. Shown is a graph of the vertical ground acceleration created by the 2011 earthquake near Tohoku, Japan. The earthquake had a magnitude of 9.0 on the Richter scale and was so powerful that it moved northern Japan 8 feet closer to North America. Functions and Models THE FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTS THAT WE deal with in calculus are functions. This chapter pre-pares the way for calculus by discussing the basic ideas concerning functions, their graphs, and ways of transforming and combining them. We stress that a function can be represented in different ways: by an equation, in a table, by a graph, or in words. We look at the main types of functions that occur in calculus and describe the process of using these functions as mathematical models of real-world phenomena.

","10 CHAPTER 1 Functions and Models Functions arise whenever one quantity depends on another. Consider the following four situations. A. The area A of a circle depends on the radius r of the circle. The rule that connects r and A is given by the equation A -H9266 r 2 . With each positive number r there is associ-ated one value of A , and we say that A is a function of r . B. The human population of the world P depends on the time t . The table gives esti-mates of the world population P s t d at time t , for certain years. For instance, P s 1950 d< 2,560,000,000 But for each value of the time t there is a corresponding value of P , and we say that P is a function of t . C. The cost C of mailing an envelope depends on its weight w . Although there is no simple formula that connects w and C , the post ofice has a rule for determining C when w is known. D. The vertical acceleration a of the ground as measured by a seismograph during an earthquake is a function of the elapsed time t . Figure 1 shows a graph generated by seismic activity during the Northridge earthquake that shook Los Angeles in 1994. For a given value of t , the graph provides a corresponding value of a . { cm / s @} (seconds) 5 50 10 15 20 25 a t 100 30 _50 Calif. Dept. of Mines and Geology Each of these examples describes a rule whereby, given a number ( r , t , w , or t ), another number ( A , P , C , or a ) is assigned. In each case we say that the second number is a function of the irst number. A function f is a rule that assigns to each element x in a set D exactly one element, called f s x d , in a set E . We usually consider functions for which the sets D and E are sets of real numbers. The set D is called the domain of the function. The number f s x d is the value of f at x and is read “ f of x .” The range of f is the set of all possible values of f s x d as x varies throughout the domain. A symbol that represents an arbitrary number in the domain of a function f is called an independent variable . A symbol that represents a number in the range of f is called a dependent variable . In Example A, for instance, r is the indepen-dent variable and A is the dependent variable.

","SECTION 1.1 Four Ways to Represent a Function 11 It’s helpful to think of a function as a machine (see Figure 2). If x is in the domain of the function f , then when x enters the machine, it’s accepted as an input and the machine produces an output f s x d according to the rule of the function. Thus we can think of the domain as the set of all possible inputs and the range as the set of all possible outputs. The preprogrammed functions in a calculator are good examples of a function as a machine. For example, the square root key on your calculator computes such a function. You press the key labeled s (or s x ) and enter the input x . If x , 0, then x is not in the domain of this function; that is, x is not an acceptable input, and the calculator will indi-cate an error. If x > 0, then an approximation to s x will appear in the display. Thus the s x key on your calculator is not quite the same as the exact mathematical function f deined by f s x d -s x . Another way to picture a function is by an arrow diagram as in Figure 3. Each arrow connects an element of D to an element of E . The arrow indicates that f s x d is associated with x , f s a d is associated with a , and so on. The most common method for visualizing a function is its graph. If f is a function with domain D , then its graph is the set of ordered pairs hs x , f s x dd | x [ D j (Notice that these are input-output pairs.) In other words, the graph of f consists of all points s x , y d in the coordinate plane such that y -f s x d and x is in the domain of f . The graph of a function f gives us a useful picture of the behavior or “life history” of a function. Since the y -coordinate of any point s x , y d on the graph is y -f s x d , we can read the value of f s x d from the graph as being the height of the graph above the point x (see Figure 4). The graph of f also allows us to picture the domain of f on the x -axis and its range on the y -axis as in Figure 5. 0 y H11005 ƒ( x ) domain range { x, ƒ} ƒ f(1) f(2) 0 1 2 x x x y y EXAMPLE 1 The graph of a function f is shown in Figure 6. (a) Find the values of f s 1 d and f s 5 d . (b) What are the domain and range of f ? SOLUTION (a) We see from Figure 6 that the point s 1, 3 d lies on the graph of f , so the value of f at 1 is f s 1 d -3. (In other words, the point on the graph that lies above x -1 is 3 units above the x -axis.) When x -5, the graph lies about 0.7 units below the x -axis, so we estimate that f s 5 d< 2 0.7. (b) We see that f s x d is deined when 0 < x < 7, so the domain of f is the closed inter-val f 0, 7 g . Notice that f takes on all values from 2 2 to 4, so the range of f is h y | 2 2 < y < 4 j -f 2 2, 4 g ■ x (input) ƒ (output) f FIGURE 2 Machine diagram for a function f f D E ƒ f(a) a x FIGURE 3 Arrow diagram for f FIGURE 4 FIGURE 5 x y 0 1 1 FIGURE 6 The notation for intervals is given in Appendix A.

","12 CHAPTER 1 Functions and Models EXAMPLE 2 Sketch the graph and ind the domain and range of each function. (a) f s x d -2 x 2 1 (b) t s x d -x 2 SOLUTION (a) The equation of the graph is y -2 x 2 1, and we recognize this as being the equa-tion of a line with slope 2 and y -intercept 2 1. (Recall the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line: y -mx 1 b . See Appendix B.) This enables us to sketch a portion of the graph of f in Figure 7. The expression 2 x 2 1 is deined for all real numbers, so the domain of f is the set of all real numbers, which we denote by R . The graph shows that the range is also R . (b) Since t s 2 d -2 2 -4 and t s 2 1 d -s 2 1 d 2 -1, we could plot the points s 2, 4 d and s 2 1, 1 d , together with a few other points on the graph, and join them to produce the graph (Figure 8). The equation of the graph is y -x 2 , which represents a parabola (see Appendix C). The domain of t is R . The range of t consists of all values of t s x d , that is, all numbers of the form x 2 . But x 2 > 0 for all numbers x and any positive number y is a square. So the range of t is h y | y > 0 j -f 0, ` d . This can also be seen from Figure 8. ■ EXAMPLE 3 If f s x d -2 x 2 2 5 x 1 1 and h ± 0, evaluate f s a 1 h d 2 f s a d h . SOLUTION We irst evaluate f s a 1 h d by replacing x by a 1 h in the expression for f s x d : f s a 1 h d -2 s a 1 h d 2 2 5 s a 1 h d 1 1 -2 s a 2 1 2 ah 1 h 2 d 2 5 s a 1 h d 1 1 -2 a 2 1 4 ah 1 2 h 2 2 5 a 2 5 h 1 1 Then we substitute into the given expression and simplify: f s a 1 h d 2 f s a d h -s 2 a 2 1 4 ah 1 2 h 2 2 5 a 2 5 h 1 1 d 2 s 2 a 2 2 5 a 1 1 d h -2 a 2 1 4 ah 1 2 h 2 2 5 a 2 5 h 1 1 2 2 a 2 1 5 a 2 1 h -4 ah 1 2 h 2 2 5 h h -4 a 1 2 h 2 5 ■ Representations of Functions There are four possible ways to represent a function: ● verbally (by a description in words) ● numerically (by a table of values) ● visually (by a graph) ● algebraically (by an explicit formula) If a single function can be represented in all four ways, it’s often useful to go from one representation to another to gain additional insight into the function. (In Example 2, for instance, we started with algebraic formulas and then obtained the graphs.) But certain functions are described more naturally by one method than by another. With this in mind, let’s reexamine the four situations that we considered at the beginning of this section. x y=2x-1 0 -1 y 1 2 FIGURE 7 (_1, 1) (2, 4) 0 y 1 x 1 y=≈ FIGURE 8 The expression f s a 1 h d 2 f s a d h in Example 3 is called a difference quotient and occurs frequently in calculus.

The most useful representation of the area of a circle as a function of its radius is probably the algebraic formula A s r d -H9266 r 2 , though it is possible to compile a table of values or to sketch a graph (half a parabola). Because a circle has to have a posi-tive radius, the domain is h r | r . 0 j -s 0, ` d , and the range is also s 0, ` d . B. We are given a description of the function in words: P s t d is the human population of the world at time t . Let’s measure t so that t -0 corresponds to the year 1900. The table of values of world population provides a convenient representation of this func-tion. If we plot these values, we get the graph (called a scatter plot) in Figure 9. It too is a useful representation; the graph allows us to absorb all the data at once. What about a formula? Of course, it’s impossible to devise an explicit formula that gives the exact human population P s t d at any time t . But it is possible to ind an expression for a function that approximates P s t d . In fact, using methods explained in Section 1.2, we obtain the approximation P s t d< f s t d -s 1.43653 3 10 9 d ∙ s 1.01395 d t Figure 10 shows that it is a reasonably good “it.” The function f is called a mathe-matical model for population growth. In other words, it is a function with an explicit formula that approximates the behavior of our given function. We will see, however, that the ideas of calculus can be applied to a table of values; an explicit formula is not necessary. 5 x 10' 5 x 10' P t 20 40 60 80 100 120 20 40 60 Years since 1900 Years since 1900 80 100 120 P t 0 0 FIGURE 9 FIGURE 10 The function P is typical of the functions that arise whenever we attempt to apply calculus to the real world. We start with a verbal description of a function. Then we may be able to construct a table of values of the function, perhaps from instrument readings in a scientiic experiment. Even though we don’t have complete knowledge of the values of the function, we will see throughout the book that it is still possible to perform the operations of calculus on such a function. C. Again the function is described in words: Let C s w d be the cost of mailing a large enve-lope with weight w . The rule that the US Postal Service used as of 2015 is as follows: The cost is 98 cents for up to 1 oz, plus 21 cents for each additional ounce (or less) up to 13 oz. The table of values shown in the margin is the most convenient repre-sentation for this function, though it is possible to sketch a graph (see Example 10). D. The graph shown in Figure 1 is the most natural representation of the vertical accel-eration function a s t d .

","14 CHAPTER 1 Functions and Models PS In setting up applied functions as in Example 5, it may be useful to review the principles of problem solving as discussed on page 71, particularly Step 1: Understand the Problem. know— amplitudes and patterns — can be seen easily from the graph. (The same is true for the patterns seen in electrocardiograms of heart patients and polygraphs for lie-detection.) In the next example we sketch the graph of a function that is deined verbally. EXAMPLE 4 When you turn on a hot-water faucet, the temperature T of the water depends on how long the water has been running. Draw a rough graph of T as a func-tion of the time t that has elapsed since the faucet was turned on. SOLUTION The initial temperature of the running water is close to room temperature because the water has been sitting in the pipes. When the water from the hot-water tank starts lowing from the faucet, T increases quickly. In the next phase, T is constant at the temperature of the heated water in the tank. When the tank is drained, T decreases to the temperature of the water supply. This enables us to make the rough sketch of T as a function of t in Figure 11. ■ In the following example we start with a verbal description of a function in a physical situation and obtain an explicit algebraic formula. The ability to do this is a useful skill in solving calculus problems that ask for the maximum or minimum values of quantities. EXAMPLE 5 A rectangular storage container with an open top has a volume of 10 m 3 . The length of its base is twice its width. Material for the base costs $10 per square meter; material for the sides costs $6 per square meter. Express the cost of mate-rials as a function of the width of the base. SOLUTION We draw a diagram as in Figure 12 and introduce notation by letting w and 2 w be the width and length of the base, respectively, and h be the height. The area of the base is s 2 w d w -2 w 2 , so the cost, in dollars, of the material for the base is 10 s 2 w 2 d . Two of the sides have area w h and the other two have area 2 w h , so the cost of the material for the sides is 6 f 2 s w h d 1 2 s 2 w h dg . The total cost is therefore C -10 s 2 w 2 d 1 6 f 2 s w h d 1 2 s 2 w h dg -20 w 2 1 36 w h To express C as a function of w alone, we need to eliminate h and we do so by using the fact that the volume is 10 m 3 . Thus w s 2 w d h -10 which gives h -10 2 w 2 -5 w 2 Substituting this into the expression for C , we have C -20 w 2 1 36 w S 5 w 2 D -20 w 2 1 180 w Therefore the equation C s w d -20 w 2 1 180 w w . 0 expresses C as a function of w . ■ EXAMPLE 6 Find the domain of each function.

","SECTION 1.1 Four Ways to Represent a Function 15 SOLUTION (a) Because the square root of a negative number is not deined (as a real number), the domain of f consists of all values of x such that x 1 2 > 0. This is equivalent to x >2 2, so the domain is the interval f 2 2, ` d . (b) Since t s x d -1 x 2 2 x -1 x s x 2 1 d and division by 0 is not allowed, we see that t s x d is not deined when x -0 or x -1. Thus the domain of t is h x | x ± 0, x ± 1 j which could also be written in interval notation as s 2` , 0 d ø s 0, 1 d ø s 1, ` d ■ The graph of a function is a curve in the xy -plane. But the question arises: Which curves in the xy -plane are graphs of functions? This is answered by the following test. The Vertical Line Test A curve in the xy -plane is the graph of a function of x if and only if no vertical line intersects the curve more than once. The reason for the truth of the Vertical Line Test can be seen in Figure 13. If each vertical line x -a intersects a curve only once, at s a , b d , then exactly one function value is deined by f s a d -b . But if a line x -a intersects the curve twice, at s a , b d and s a , c d , then the curve can’t represent a function because a function can’t assign two different values to a . For example, the parabola x -y 2 2 2 shown in Figure 14(a) is not the graph of a function of x because, as you can see, there are vertical lines that intersect the parabola twice. The parabola, however, does contain the graphs of two functions of x . Notice that the equation x -y 2 2 2 implies y 2 -x 1 2, so y -6 s x 1 2 . Thus the upper and lower halves of the parabola are the graphs of the functions f s x d -s x 1 2 [from Example 6(a)] and t s x d -2 s x 1 2 . [See Figures 14(b) and (c).] We observe that if we reverse the roles of x and y , then the equation x -h s y d -y 2 2 2 does deine x as a function of y (with y as the independent variable and x as the depen-dent variable) and the parabola now appears as the graph of the function h .

","16 CHAPTER 1 Functions and Models EXAMPLE 7 A function f is deined by f s x d -H 1 2 x x 2 if x <2 1 if x .2 1 Evaluate f s 2 2 d , f s 2 1 d , and f s 0 d and sketch the graph. SOLUTION Remember that a function is a rule. For this particular function the rule is the following: First look at the value of the input x . If it happens that x <2 1, then the value of f s x d is 1 2 x . On the other hand, if x .2 1, then the value of f s x d is x 2 . Since 2 2 <2 1, we have f s 2 2 d -1 2 s 2 2 d -3. Since 2 1 <2 1, we have f s 2 1 d -1 2 s 2 1 d -2. Since 0 .2 1, we have f s 0 d -0 2 -0. How do we draw the graph of f ? We observe that if x <2 1, then f s x d -1 2 x , so the part of the graph of f that lies to the left of the vertical line x -2 1 must coin-cide with the line y -1 2 x , which has slope 2 1 and y -intercept 1. If x .2 1, then f s x d -x 2 , so the part of the graph of f that lies to the right of the line x -2 1 must coincide with the graph of y -x 2 , which is a parabola. This enables us to sketch the graph in Figure 15. The solid dot indicates that the point s 2 1, 2 d is included on the graph; the open dot indicates that the point s 2 1, 1 d is excluded from the graph. ■ The next example of a piecewise deined function is the absolute value function. Recall that the absolute value of a number a , denoted by | a | , is the distance from a to 0 on the real number line. Distances are always positive or 0, so we have | a | > 0 for every number a For example, | 3 | -3 | 2 3 | -3 | 0 | -0 | s 2 2 1 | -s 2 2 1 | 3 2 H9266 | -H9266 2 3 In general, we have | a | -a if a > 0 | a | -2 a if a , 0 (Remember that if a is negative, then 2 a is positive.) EXAMPLE 8 Sketch the graph of the absolute value function f s x d -| x | . SOLUTION From the preceding discussion we know that | x | -H x 2 x if x > 0 if x , 0 Using the same method as in Example 7, we see that the graph of f coincides with the line y -x to the right of the y -axis and coincides with the line y -2 x to the left of the y -axis (see Figure 16). ■ 1 x y 1 _1 0 FIGURE 15 For a more extensive review of absolute values, see Appendix A. x y= |x| 0 y FIGURE 16 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 1.1 Four Ways to Represent a Function 17 Point-slope form of the equation of a line: y 2 y 1 -m s x 2 x 1 d See Appendix B. EXAMPLE 9 Find a formula for the function f graphed in Figure 17. SOLUTION The line through s 0, 0 d and s 1, 1 d has slope m -1 and y -intercept b -0, so its equation is y -x . Thus, for the part of the graph of f that joins s 0, 0 d to s 1, 1 d , we have f s x d -x if 0 < x < 1 The line through s 1, 1 d and s 2, 0 d has slope m -2 1, so its point-slope form is y 2 0 -s 2 1 ds x 2 2 d or y -2 2 x So we have f s x d -2 2 x if 1 , x < 2 We also see that the graph of f coincides with the x -axis for x . 2. Putting this infor-mation together, we have the following three-piece formula for f : f s x d -H x 2 2 x 0 if 0 < x < 1 if 1 , x < 2 if x . 2 ■ EXAMPLE 10 In Example C at the beginning of this section we considered the cost C s w d of mailing a large envelope with weight w . In effect, this is a piecewise deined function because, from the table of values on page 13, we have C s w d -0.98 1.19 1.40 1.61 if 0 , w < 1 if 1 , w < 2 if 2 , w < 3 if 3 , w < 4 ∙ ∙ ∙ The graph is shown in Figure 18. You can see why functions similar to this one are called step functions —they jump from one value to the next. Such functions will be studied in Chapter 2. ■ Symmetry If a function f satisies f s 2 x d -f s x d for every number x in its domain, then f is called an even function . For instance, the function f s x d -x 2 is even because f s 2 x d -s 2 x d 2 -x 2 -f s x d The geometric signiicance of an even function is that its graph is symmetric with respect to the y -axis (see Figure 19). This means that if we have plotted the graph of f for x > 0, we obtain the entire graph simply by relecting this portion about the y -axis. If f satisies f s 2 x d -2 f s x d for every number x in its domain, then f is called an odd function . For example, the function f s x d -x 3 is odd because f s 2 x d -s 2 x d 3 -2 x 3 -2 f s x d x y 0 1 1 FIGURE 17 FIGURE 19 An even function 0 x _x f(_x) ƒ x y C 0.50 1.00 1.50 0 123 5 4 w FIGURE 18 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","18 CHAPTER 1 Functions and Models The graph of an odd function is symmetric about the origin (see Figure 20). If we already have the graph of f for x > 0, we can obtain the entire graph by rotating this portion through 180 8 about the origin. EXAMPLE 11 Determine whether each of the following functions is even, odd, or neither even nor odd. (a) f s x d -x 5 1 x (b) t s x d -1 2 x 4 (c) h s x d -2 x 2 x 2 SOLUTION (a) f s 2 x d -s 2 x d 5 1 s 2 x d -s 2 1 d 5 x 5 1 s 2 x d -2 x 5 2 x -2 s x 5 1 x d -2 f s x d Therefore f is an odd function.

(c) h s 2 x d -2 s 2 x d 2 s 2 x d 2 -2 2 x 2 x 2 Since h s 2 x d ± h s x d and h s 2 x d ± 2 h s x d , we conclude that h is neither even nor odd. ■ The graphs of the functions in Example 11 are shown in Figure 21.

A mathematical model is a mathematical description (often by means of a function or an equation) of a real-world phenomenon such as the size of a population, the demand for a product, the speed of a falling object, the concentration of a product in a chemical reaction, the life expectancy of a person at birth, or the cost of emission reductions. The purpose of the model is to understand the phenomenon and perhaps to make predictions about future behavior. Figure 1 illustrates the process of mathematical modeling. Given a real-world prob-lem, our irst task is to formulate a mathematical model by identifying and naming the independent and dependent variables and making assumptions that simplify the phenom-enon enough to make it mathematically tractable. We use our knowledge of the physical situation and our mathematical skills to obtain equations that relate the variables. In situations where there is no physical law to guide us, we may need to collect data (either from a library or the Internet or by conducting our own experiments) and examine the data in the form of a table in order to discern patterns. From this numerical representation of a function we may wish to obtain a graphical representation by plotting the data. The graph might even suggest a suitable algebraic formula in some cases. Real-world problem Mathematical model Real-world predictions Mathematical conclusions Test Formulate Solve Interpret The second stage is to apply the mathematics that we know (such as the calculus that will be developed throughout this book) to the mathematical model that we have formulated in order to derive mathematical conclusions. Then, in the third stage, we take those mathematical conclusions and interpret them as information about the original real-world phenomenon by way of offering explanations or making predictions. The inal step is to test our predictions by checking against new real data. If the predictions don’t compare well with reality, we need to reine our model or to formulate a new model and start the cycle again. A mathematical model is never a completely accurate representation of a physical situation—it is an idealization . A good model simpliies reality enough to permit math-FIGURE 1 The modeling process Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

In the end, Mother Nature has the inal say. There are many different types of functions that can be used to model relationships observed in the real world. In what follows, we discuss the behavior and graphs of these functions and give examples of situations appropriately modeled by such functions. Linear Models When we say that y is a linear function of x , we mean that the graph of the function is a line, so we can use the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line to write a formula for the function as y -f s x d -mx 1 b where m is the slope of the line and b is the y -intercept. A characteristic feature of linear functions is that they grow at a constant rate. For instance, Figure 2 shows a graph of the linear function f s x d -3 x 2 2 and a table of sample values. Notice that whenever x increases by 0.1, the value of f s x d increases by 0.3. So f s x d increases three times as fast as x . Thus the slope of the graph y -3 x 2 2, namely 3, can be interpreted as the rate of change of y with respect to x . x y 0 y=3x-2 _2 1 x f s x d -3 x 2 2 1.0 1.0 1.1 1.3 1.2 1.6 1.3 1.9 1.4 2.2 1.5 2.5 EXAMPLE 1 (a) As dry air moves upward, it expands and cools. If the ground temperature is 20°C and the temperature at a height of 1 km is 10°C, express the temperature T (in °C) as a function of the height h (in kilometers), assuming that a linear model is appropriate. (b) Draw the graph of the function in part (a). What does the slope represent? (c) What is the temperature at a height of 2.5 km? SOLUTION (a) Because we are assuming that T is a linear function of h , we can write T -mh 1 b We are given that T -20 when h -0, so 20 -m ? 0 1 b -b In other words, the y -intercept is b -20.

We seek a curve that “its” the data in the sense that it captures the basic trend of the data points.

Use the data in Table 1 to ind a model for the carbon dioxide level.

If we use a graphing calculator, we enter the data from Table 1 into the data editor and choose the linear regression command. (With Maple we use the it[leastsquare] com-mand in the stats package; with Mathematica we use the Fit command.) The machine gives the slope and y -intercept of the regression line as m -1.71262 b -2 3054.14 So our least squares model for the CO 2 level is 2 C -1.71262 t 2 3054.14 In Figure 6 we graph the regression line as well as the data points.

","SECTION 1.2 Mathematical Models: A Catalog of Essential Functions 27 EXAMPLE 3 Use the linear model given by Equation 2 to estimate the average CO 2 level for 1987 and to predict the level for the year 2020. According to this model, when will the CO 2 level exceed 420 parts per million? SOLUTION Using Equation 2 with t -1987, we estimate that the average CO 2 level in 1987 was C s 1987 d -s 1.71262 ds 1987 d 2 3054.14 < 348.84 This is an example of interpolation because we have estimated a value between observed values. (In fact, the Mauna Loa Observatory reported that the average CO 2 level in 1987 was 348.93 ppm, so our estimate is quite accurate.) With t -2020, we get C s 2020 d -s 1.71262 ds 2020 d 2 3054.14 < 405.35 So we predict that the average CO 2 level in the year 2020 will be 405.4 ppm. This is an example of extrapolation because we have predicted a value outside the time frame of observations. Consequently, we are far less certain about the accuracy of our prediction. Using Equation 2, we see that the CO 2 level exceeds 420 ppm when 1.71262 t 2 3054.14 . 420 Solving this inequality, we get t . 3474.14 1.71262 < 2028.55 We therefore predict that the CO 2 level will exceed 420 ppm by the year 2029. This prediction is risky because it involves a time quite remote from our observations. In fact, we see from Figure 6 that the trend has been for CO 2 levels to increase rather more rapidly in recent years, so the level might exceed 420 ppm well before 2029. ■ Polynomials A function P is called a polynomial if P s x d -a n x n 1 a n 2 1 x n 2 1 1 ∙∙∙ 1 a 2 x 2 1 a 1 x 1 a 0 where n is a nonnegative integer and the numbers a 0 , a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a n are constants called the coeficients of the polynomial. The domain of any polynomial is R -s 2` , ` d . If the leading coeficient a n ± 0, then the degree of the polynomial is n . For example, the function P s x d -2 x 6 2 x 4 1 2 5 x 3 1 s 2 is a polynomial of degree 6. A polynomial of degree 1 is of the form P s x d -mx 1 b and so it is a linear function. A polynomial of degree 2 is of the form P s x d -ax 2 1 bx 1 c and is called a quadratic function . Its graph is always a parabola obtained by shifting the parabola y -ax 2 , as we will see in the next section. The parabola opens upward if a . 0 and downward if a , 0. (See Figure 7.) A polynomial of degree 3 is of the form P s x d -ax 3 1 bx 2 1 cx 1 d a ± 0 FIGURE 7 The graphs of quadratic functions are parabolas. 0 y 2 x 1 (a) y=≈+x+1 y 2 x 1 (b) y=_2≈+3x+1 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

For instance, in Section 3.7 we will explain why economists often use a polynomial P s x d to represent the cost of producing x units of a commodity. In the fol-lowing example we use a quadratic function to model the fall of a ball. EXAMPLE 4 A ball is dropped from the upper observation deck of the CN Tower, 450 m above the ground, and its height h above the ground is recorded at 1-second intervals in Table 2. Find a model to it the data and use the model to predict the time at which the ball hits the ground. SOLUTION We draw a scatter plot of the data in Figure 9 and observe that a linear model is inappropriate. But it looks as if the data points might lie on a parabola, so we try a quadratic model instead. Using a graphing calculator or computer algebra system (which uses the least squares method), we obtain the following quadratic model: 3 h -449.36 1 0.96 t 2 4.90 t 2 2 200 400 468 t 0 200 400 t (seconds) 0 2 468 h h (meters) In Figure 10 we plot the graph of Equation 3 together with the data points and see that the quadratic model gives a very good it.

We consider several cases. (i) a -n , where n is a positive integer The graphs of f s x d -x n for n -1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are shown in Figure 11. (These are poly-nomials with only one term.)

If n is even, then f s x d -x n is an even function and its graph is similar to the parabola y -x 2 . If n is odd, then f s x d -x n is an odd function and its graph is similar to that of y -x 3 . Notice from Figure 12, however, that as n increases, the graph of y -x n becomes latter near 0 and steeper when | x | > 1. (If x is small, then x 2 is smaller, x 3 is even smaller, x 4 is smaller still, and so on.) y=x$ (1, 1) (_1, 1) y=x^ y=≈ (_1, _1) (1, 1) 0 y x x y 0 y=x# y=x% (ii) a -1 y n , where n is a positive integer The function f s x d -x 1 y n -s n x is a root function .

[See Figure 13(a).] For other even values of n , the graph of y -s n x is similar to that of y -s x .

Its graph has the equation y -1 y x , or xy -1, and is a hyperbola with the coordinate axes as its asymptotes. This function arises in physics and chemistry in connection with Boyle’s Law, which says that, when the temperature is constant, the volume V of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure P : V -C P where C is a constant. Thus the graph of V as a function of P (see Figure 15) has the same general shape as the right half of Figure 14. Power functions are also used to model species-area relationships (Exercises 30–31), illumination as a function of distance from a light source (Exercise 29), and the period of revolution of a planet as a function of its distance from the sun (Exercise 32). Rational Functions A rational function f is a ratio of two polynomials: f s x d -P s x d Q s x d where P and Q are polynomials. The domain consists of all values of x such that Q s x d ± 0. A simple example of a rational function is the function f s x d -1 y x , whose domain is h x | x ± 0 j ; this is the reciprocal function graphed in Figure 14. The function f s x d -2 x 4 2 x 2 1 1 x 2 2 4 is a rational function with domain h x | x ± 6 2 j . Its graph is shown in Figure 16. Algebraic Functions A function f is called an algebraic function if it can be constructed using algebraic operations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and taking roots) start-ing with polynomials. Any rational function is automatically an algebraic function. Here are two more examples: f s x d -s x 2 1 1 t s x d -x 4 2 16 x 2 x 1 s x 1 s x 2 2 d s 3 x 1 1 FIGURE 13 Graphs of root functions x 1 y 1 0 y=∆ FIGURE 14 The reciprocal function P V 0 FIGURE 15 Volume as a function of pressure at constant temperature ƒ= 2x $-≈+1 ≈-4 x 20 y 2 0 FIGURE 16 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Trigonometric Functions Trigonometry and the trigonometric functions are reviewed on Reference Page 2 and also in Appendix D. In calculus the convention is that radian measure is always used (except when otherwise indicated). For example, when we use the function f s x d -sin x , it is understood that sin x means the sine of the angle whose radian measure is x . Thus the graphs of the sine and cosine functions are as shown in Figure 18.

Thus, for all values of x , we have 2 1 < sin x < 1 2 1 < cos x < 1 or, in terms of absolute values, | sin x | < 1 | cos x | < 1 Also, the zeros of the sine function occur at the integer multiples of H9266 ; that is, sin x -0 when x -n H9266 n an integer FIGURE 17 The Reference Pages are located at the back of the book.

This means that, for all values of x , sin s x 1 2 H9266 d -sin x cos s x 1 2 H9266 d -cos x The periodic nature of these functions makes them suitable for modeling repetitive phe-nomena such as tides, vibrating springs, and sound waves. For instance, in Example 1.3.4 we will see that a reasonable model for the number of hours of daylight in Philadelphia t days after January 1 is given by the function L s t d -12 1 2.8 sin F 2 H9266 365 s t 2 80 d G EXAMPLE 5 What is the domain of the function f s x d -1 1 2 2 cos x ?

So the domain of f is the set of all real numbers except for the ones noted above. ■ The tangent function is related to the sine and cosine functions by the equation tan x -sin x cos x and its graph is shown in Figure 19. It is undeined whenever cos x -0, that is, when x -6 H9266 y 2, 6 3 H9266 y 2, .... Its range is s 2` , ` d . Notice that the tangent function has period H9266 : tan s x 1 H9266 d -tan x for all x The remaining three trigonometric functions (cosecant, secant, and cotangent) are the reciprocals of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions. Their graphs are shown in Appendix D. Exponential Functions The exponential function s are the functions of the form f s x d -b x , where the base b is a positive constant. The graphs of y -2 x and y -s 0.5 d x are shown in Figure 20. In both cases the domain is s 2` , ` d and the range is s 0, ` d . Exponential functions will be studied in detail in Section 1.4, and we will see that they are useful for modeling many natural phenomena, such as population growth (if b . 1) and radioactive decay (if b , 1 d . Logarithmic Functions The logarithmic functions f s x d -log b x , where the base b is a positive constant, are the inverse functions of the exponential functions.

Many physical quantities are connected by inverse square laws , that is, by power functions of the form f s x d -kx 2 2 . In particular, the illumination of an object by a light source is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. Suppose that after dark you are in a room with just one lamp and you are trying to read a book. The light is too dim and so you move halfway to the lamp. How much brighter is the light? 30. It makes sense that the larger the area of a region, the larger the number of species that inhabit the region. Many ecolo-gists have modeled the species-area relation with a power function and, in particular, the number of species S of bats living in caves in central Mexico has been related to the surface area A of the caves by the equation S -0.7 A 0.3 .

This will give us the ability to sketch the graphs of many functions quickly by hand. It will also enable us to write equations for given graphs. Let’s irst consider translations .

","40 CHAPTER 1 Functions and Models SOLUTION Notice that each curve resembles a shifted and stretched sine function. By looking at the blue curve we see that, at the latitude of Philadelphia, daylight lasts about 14.8 hours on June 21 and 9.2 hours on December 21, so the amplitude of the curve (the factor by which we have to stretch the sine curve vertically) is 1 2 s 14.8 2 9.2 d -2.8. By what factor do we need to stretch the sine curve horizontally if we measure the time t in days? Because there are about 365 days in a year, the period of our model should be 365. But the period of y -sin t is 2 H9266 , so the horizontal stretching factor is 2 H9266 y 365. We also notice that the curve begins its cycle on March 21, the 80th day of the year, so we have to shift the curve 80 units to the right. In addition, we shift it 12 units upward. Therefore we model the length of daylight in Philadelphia on the t th day of the year by the function L s t d -12 1 2.8 sin F 2 H9266 365 s t 2 80 d G ■ Another transformation of some interest is taking the absolute value of a function. If y -| f s x d | , then according to the deinition of absolute value, y -f s x d when f s x d > 0 and y -2 f s x d when f s x d , 0. This tells us how to get the graph of y -| f s x d | from the graph of y -f s x d : The part of the graph that lies above the x -axis remains the same; the part that lies below the x -axis is relected about the x -axis. EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the graph of the function y -| x 2 2 1 | . SOLUTION We irst graph the parabola y -x 2 2 1 in Figure 10(a) by shifting the parabola y -x 2 downward 1 unit. We see that the graph lies below the x -axis when 2 1 , x , 1, so we relect that part of the graph about the x -axis to obtain the graph of y -| x 2 2 1 | in Figure 10(b). ■ Combinations of Functions Two functions f and t can be combined to form new functions f 1 t , f 2 t , f t , and f y t in a manner similar to the way we add, subtract, multiply, and divide real numbers. The sum and difference functions are deined by s f 1 t ds x d -f s x d 1 t s x d s f 2 t ds x d -f s x d 2 t s x d If the domain of f is A and the domain of t is B , then the domain of f 1 t is the inter-section A > B because both f s x d and t s x d have to be deined. For example, the domain of f s x d -s x is A -f 0, ` d and the domain of t s x d -s 2 2 x is B -s 2` , 2 g , so the domain of s f 1 t ds x d -s x 1 s 2 2 x is A > B -f 0, 2 g . Similarly, the product and quotient functions are deined by s f t ds x d -f s x d t s x d S f t D s x d -f s x d t s x d The domain of f t is A > B , but we can’t divide by 0 and so the domain of f y t is h x [ A > B | t s x d ± 0 j . For instance, if f s x d -x 2 and t s x d -x 2 1, then the domain of the rational function s f y t ds x d -x 2 ys x 2 1 d is h x | x ± 1 j , or s 2` , 1 d ø s 1, ` d . There is another way of combining two functions to obtain a new function. For example, suppose that y -f s u d -s u and u -t s x d -x 2 1 1. Since y is a function of u and u is, in turn, a function of x , it follows that y is ultimately a function of x .

","SECTION 1.3 New Functions from Old Functions 41 We compute this by substitution: y -f s u d -f s t s x dd -f s x 2 1 1 d -s x 2 1 1 The procedure is called composition because the new function is composed of the two given functions f and t . In general, given any two functions f and t , we start with a number x in the domain of t and calculate t s x d . If this number t s x d is in the domain of f , then we can calculate the value of f s t s x dd . Notice that the output of one function is used as the input to the next function. The result is a new function h s x d -f s t s x dd obtained by substituting t into f . It is called the composition (or composite ) of f and t and is denoted by f 8 t (“ f circle t ”). Deinition Given two functions f and t , the composite function f 8 t (also called the composition of f and t ) is deined by s f 8 t ds x d -f s t s x dd The domain of f 8 t is the set of all x in the domain of t such that t s x d is in the domain of f . In other words, s f 8 t ds x d is deined whenever both t s x d and f s t s x dd are deined. Figure 11 shows how to picture f 8 t in terms of machines. EXAMPLE 6 If f s x d -x 2 and t s x d -x 2 3, ind the composite functions f 8 t and t 8 f . SOLUTION We have s f 8 t ds x d -f s t s x dd -f s x 2 3 d -s x 2 3 d 2 s t 8 f ds x d -t s f s x dd -t s x 2 d -x 2 2 3 ■ NOTE You can see from Example 6 that, in general, f 8 t ± t 8 f . Remember, the notation f 8 t means that the function t is applied irst and then f is applied second. In Example 6, f 8 t is the function that irst subtracts 3 and then squares; t 8 f is the function that irst squares and then subtracts 3. EXAMPLE 7 If f s x d -s x and t s x d -s 2 2 x , ind each of the following functions and their domains. (a) f 8 t (b) t 8 f (c) f 8 f (d) t 8 t SOLUTION (a) s f 8 t ds x d -f s t s x dd -f ( s 2 2 x ) -s s 2 2 x -s 4 2 2 x The domain of f 8 t is h x | 2 2 x > 0 j -h x | x < 2 j -s 2` , 2 g . (b) s t 8 f ds x d -t s f s x dd -t ( s x ) -s 2 2 s x For s x to be deined we must have x > 0. For s 2 2 s x to be deined we must have 2 2 s x > 0, that is, s x < 2, or x < 4. Thus we have 0 < x < 4, so the domain of t 8 f is the closed interval f 0, 4 g . (c) s f 8 f ds x d -f s f s x dd -f ( s x ) -s s x -s 4 x The domain of f 8 f is f 0, ` d .

The irst inequality means x < 2, and the second is equivalent to s 2 2 x < 2, or 2 2 x < 4, or x >2 2. Thus 2 2 < x < 2, so the domain of t 8 t is the closed interval f 2 2, 2 g . ■ It is possible to take the composition of three or more functions.

","46 CHAPTER 1 Functions and Models If x is a rational number, x -p y q , where p and q are integers and q . 0, then b x -b p y q -s q b p -s s q b d p But what is the meaning of b x if x is an irrational number? For instance, what is meant by 2 s 3 or 5 H9266 ? To help us answer this question we irst look at the graph of the function y -2 x , where x is rational. A representation of this graph is shown in Figure 1. We want to enlarge the domain of y -2 x to include both rational and irrational numbers. There are holes in the graph in Figure 1 corresponding to irrational values of x . We want to ill in the holes by deining f s x d -2 x , where x [ R , so that f is an increasing function. In particular, since the irrational number s 3 satisies 1.7 , s 3 , 1.8 we must have 2 1.7 , 2 s 3 , 2 1.8 and we know what 2 1.7 and 2 1.8 mean because 1.7 and 1.8 are rational numbers. Similarly, if we use better approximations for s 3 , we obtain better approximations for 2 s 3 : 1.73 , s 3 , 1.74 ? 2 1.73 , 2 s 3 , 2 1.74 1.732 , s 3 , 1.733 ? 2 1.732 , 2 s 3 , 2 1.733 1.7320 , s 3 , 1.7321 ? 2 1.7320 , 2 s 3 , 2 1.7321 1.73205 , s 3 , 1.73206 ? 2 1.73205 , 2 s 3 , 2 1.73206 . . . . . . . . . . . . It can be shown that there is exactly one number that is greater than all of the numbers 2 1.7 , 2 1.73 , 2 1.732 , 2 1.7320 , 2 1.73205 , . . . and less than all of the numbers 2 1.8 , 2 1.74 , 2 1.733 , 2 1.7321 , 2 1.73206 , . . . We deine 2 s 3 to be this number. Using the preceding approximation process we can compute it correct to six decimal places: 2 s 3 < 3.321997 Similarly, we can deine 2 x (or b x , if b . 0) where x is any irrational number.

Observe that if b ± 1, then the exponential function y -b x has domain R and range s 0, ` d . Notice also that, since s 1 y b d x -1 y b x -b 2 x , the graph of y -s 1 y b d x is just the relection of the graph of y -b x about the y -axis.

Here we indicate briely how it arises in the description of population growth and radioactive decay. In later chapters we will pursue these and other applications in greater detail. First we consider a population of bacteria in a homogeneous nutrient medium. Suppose that by sampling the population at certain intervals it is determined that the population doubles every hour. If the number of bacteria at time t is p s t d , where t is measured in hours, and the initial population is p s 0 d -1000, then we have p s 1 d -2 p s 0 d -2 3 1000 p s 2 d -2 p s 1 d -2 2 3 1000 p s 3 d -2 p s 2 d -2 3 3 1000 FIGURE 5 Example 2 shows that y -2 x increases more quickly than y -x 2 . To demon-strate just how quickly f s x d -2 x increases, let’s perform the following thought experiment. Suppose we start with a piece of paper a thousandth of an inch thick and we fold it in half 50 times. Each time we fold the paper in half, the thickness of the paper doubles, so the thickness of the resulting paper would be 2 50 y 1000 inches. How thick do you think that is? It works out to be more than 17 million miles! Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

Figure 9 shows the graph of this exponential function together with the original data points. We see that the exponential curve its the data rea-sonably well.

So let’s model the function V s t d by an exponential function. Using a graphing calculator or computer to it the data in Table 2 with an exponential function of the form y -a ? b t , we obtain the model V -96.39785 ? s 0.818656 d t In Figure 11 we graph this exponential function with the data points and see that the model represents the viral load reasonably well for the irst month of treatment.

So the mass of the sample will be reduced to 5 mg after about 57 years. ■ The Number e Of all possible bases for an exponential function, there is one that is most convenient for the purposes of calculus. The choice of a base b is inluenced by the way the graph of y -b x crosses the y -axis. Figures 13 and 14 show the tangent lines to the graphs of y -2 x and y -3 x at the point s 0, 1 d . (Tangent lines will be deined precisely in Section 2.7. For present purposes, you can think of the tangent line to an exponential graph at a point as the line that touches the graph only at that point.)

In view of Figures 13 and 14, it comes as no surprise that the number e lies between 2 and 3 and the graph of y -e x lies between the graphs of y -2 x and y -3 x . (See Figure 16.)

This function is called the inverse function of f , denoted by f 2 1 , and read “ f inverse.” Thus t -f 2 1 s N d is the time required for the population level to reach N .

","56 CHAPTER 1 Functions and Models 1 Deinition A function f is called a one-to-one function if it never takes on the same value twice; that is, f s x 1 d ± f s x 2 d whenever x 1 ± x 2 In the language of inputs and outputs, this deinition says that f is one-to-one if each output corresponds to only one input. If a horizontal line intersects the graph of f in more than one point, then we see from Figure 2 that there are numbers x 1 and x 2 such that f s x 1 d -f s x 2 d . This means that f is not one-to-one. 0 ‡ fl y=ƒ y x / ¤ Therefore we have the following geometric method for determining whether a func-tion is one-to-one. Horizontal Line Test A function is one-to-one if and only if no horizontal line intersects its graph more than once. EXAMPLE 1 Is the function f s x d -x 3 one-to-one? SOLUTION 1 If x 1 ± x 2 , then x 3 1 ± x 3 2 (two different numbers can’t have the same cube). Therefore, by Deinition 1, f s x d -x 3 is one-to-one. SOLUTION 2 From Figure 3 we see that no horizontal line intersects the graph of f s x d -x 3 more than once. Therefore, by the Horizontal Line Test, f is one-to-one. ■ EXAMPLE 2 Is the function t s x d -x 2 one-to-one? SOLUTION 1 This function is not one-to-one because, for instance, t s 1 d -1 -t s 2 1 d and so 1 and 2 1 have the same output. SOLUTION 2 From Figure 4 we see that there are horizontal lines that intersect the graph of t more than once. Therefore, by the Horizontal Line Test, t is not one-to-one. ■ One-to-one functions are important because they are precisely the functions that pos-sess inverse functions according to the following deinition. 2 Deinition Let f be a one-to-one function with domain A and range B . Then its inverse function f 2 1 has domain B and range A and is deined by f 2 1 s y d -x &? f s x d -y for any y in B . FIGURE 2 This function is not one-to-one because f s x 1 d -f s x 2 d .

","SECTION 1.5 Inverse Functions and Logarithms 57 This deinition says that if f maps x into y , then f 2 1 maps y back into x . (If f were not one-to-one, then f 2 1 would not be uniquely deined.) The arrow diagram in Figure 5 indicates that f 2 1 reverses the effect of f . Note that domain of f 2 1 -range of f range of f 2 1 -domain of f For example, the inverse function of f s x d -x 3 is f 2 1 s x d -x 1 y 3 because if y -x 3 , then f 2 1 s y d -f 2 1 s x 3 d -s x 3 d 1 y 3 -x CAUTION Do not mistake the 2 1 in f 2 1 for an exponent. Thus f 2 1 s x d does not mean 1 f s x d The reciprocal 1 y f s x d could, however, be written as f f s x dg 2 1 . EXAMPLE 3 If f s 1 d -5, f s 3 d -7, and f s 8 d -2 10, ind f 2 1 s 7 d , f 2 1 s 5 d , and f 2 1 s 2 10 d . SOLUTION From the deinition of f 2 1 we have f 2 1 s 7 d -3 because f s 3 d -7 f 2 1 s 5 d -1 because f s 1 d -5 f 2 1 s 2 10 d -8 because f s 8 d -2 10 The diagram in Figure 6 makes it clear how f 2 1 reverses the effect of f in this case. ■ The letter x is traditionally used as the independent variable, so when we concentrate on f 2 1 rather than on f , we usually reverse the roles of x and y in Deinition 2 and write 3 f 2 1 s x d -y &? f s y d -x By substituting for y in Deinition 2 and substituting for x in (3), we get the follow-ing cancellation equations : 4 f 2 1 s f s x dd -x for every x in A f s f 2 1 s x dd -x for every x in B FIGURE 5 x y A B f–! f B 5 7 _10 f A 1 3 8 A 1 3 8 f–!

","58 CHAPTER 1 Functions and Models The irst cancellation equation says that if we start with x , apply f , and then apply f 2 1 , we arrive back at x , where we started (see the machine diagram in Figure 7). Thus f 2 1 undoes what f does. The second equation says that f undoes what f 2 1 does. x x f ƒ f–! For example, if f s x d -x 3 , then f 2 1 s x d -x 1 y 3 and so the cancellation equations become f 2 1 s f s x dd -s x 3 d 1 y 3 -x f s f 2 1 s x dd -s x 1 y 3 d 3 -x These equations simply say that the cube function and the cube root function cancel each other when applied in succession. Now let’s see how to compute inverse functions. If we have a function y -f s x d and are able to solve this equation for x in terms of y , then according to Deinition 2 we must have x -f 2 1 s y d . If we want to call the independent variable x , we then interchange x and y and arrive at the equation y -f 2 1 s x d . 5 How to Find the Inverse Function of a One-to-One Function f STEP 1 Write y -f s x d . STEP 2 Solve this equation for x in terms of y (if possible). STEP 3 To express f 2 1 as a function of x , interchange x and y . The resulting equation is y -f 2 1 s x d . EXAMPLE 4 Find the inverse function of f s x d -x 3 1 2. SOLUTION According to (5) we irst write y -x 3 1 2 Then we solve this equation for x : x 3 -y 2 2 x -s 3 y 2 2 Finally, we interchange x and y : y -s 3 x 2 2 Therefore the inverse function is f 2 1 s x d -s 3 x 2 2 . ■ The principle of interchanging x and y to ind the inverse function also gives us the method for obtaining the graph of f 2 1 from the graph of f . Since f s a d -b if and only if f 2 1 s b d -a , the point s a , b d is on the graph of f if and only if the point s b , a d is on the FIGURE 7 In Example 4, notice how f 2 1 reverses the effect of f .

EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the graphs of f s x d -s 2 1 2 x and its inverse function using the same coordinate axes. SOLUTION First we sketch the curve y -s 2 1 2 x (the top half of the parabola y 2 -2 1 2 x , or x -2 y 2 2 1) and then we relect about the line y -x to get the graph of f 2 1 . (See Figure 10.) As a check on our graph, notice that the expression for f 2 1 is f 2 1 s x d -2 x 2 2 1, x > 0. So the graph of f 2 1 is the right half of the parabola y -2 x 2 2 1 and this seems reasonable from Figure 10. ■ Logarithmic Functions If b . 0 and b ± 1, the exponential function f s x d -b x is either increasing or decreasing and so it is one-to-one by the Horizontal Line Test. It therefore has an inverse function f 2 1 , which is called the logarithmic function with base b and is denoted by log b . If we use the formulation of an inverse function given by (3), f 2 1 s x d -y &? f s y d -x then we have 6 log b x -y &? b y -x Thus, if x . 0, then log b x is the exponent to which the base b must be raised to give x .

Figure 11 shows the case where b . 1. (The most important logarithmic functions have base b . 1.) The fact that y -b x is a very rapidly increasing function for x . 0 is relected in the fact that y -log b x is a very slowly increasing function for x . 1. Figure 12 shows the graphs of y -log b x with various values of the base b . 1.

The logarithm with base e is called the natural logarithm and has a special notation: log e x -ln x If we put b -e and replace log e with “ln” in (6) and (7), then the deining properties of the natural logarithm function become FIGURE 11 0 y=x y=b®, b>1 y= log b x, b>1 y x FIGURE 12 Notation for Logarithms Most textbooks in calculus and the sciences, as well as calculators, use the notation ln x for the natural logarithm and log x for the “common logarithm,” log 10 x .

Similarly, Formula 10 allows us to graph any logarithmic function on a graph-ing calculator or computer (see Exercises 43 and 44). EXAMPLE 10 Evaluate log 8 5 correct to six decimal places. SOLUTION Formula 10 gives log 8 5 -ln 5 ln 8 < 0.773976 ■ Graph and Growth of the Natural Logarithm The graphs of the exponential function y -e x and its inverse function, the natural loga-rithm function, are shown in Figure 13. Because the curve y -e x crosses the y -axis with a slope of 1, it follo ws that the relected curve y -ln x crosses the x -axis with a slope of 1. In common with all other logarithmic functions with base greater than 1, the natural logarithm is an increasing function deined on s 0, ` d and the y -axis is a vertical asymp-tote. (This means that the values of ln x become very large negative as x approaches 0.) EXAMPLE 11 Sketch the graph of the function y -ln s x 2 2 d 2 1. SOLUTION We start with the graph of y -ln x as given in Figure 13. Using the transfor- mations of Section 1.3, we shift it 2 units to the right to get the graph of y -ln s x 2 2 d and then we shift it 1 unit downward to get the graph of y -ln s x 2 2 d 2 1.

","SECTION 1.5 Inverse Functions and Logarithms 63 Although ln x is an increasing function, it grows very slowly when x . 1. In fact, ln x grows more slowly than any positive power of x . To illustrate this fact, we compare approximate values of the functions y -ln x and y -x 1 y 2 -s x in the following table and we graph them in Figures 15 and 16. You can see that initially the graphs of y -s x and y -ln x grow at comparable rates, but eventually the root function far surpasses the logarithm. x 1 2 5 10 50 100 500 1000 10,000 100,000 ln x 0 0.69 1.61 2.30 3.91 4.6 6.2 6.9 9.2 11.5 s x 1 1.41 2.24 3.16 7.07 10.0 22.4 31.6 100 316 ln x s x 0 0.49 0.72 0.73 0.55 0.46 0.28 0.22 0.09 0.04 x 0 y 1000 20 y=oe „ x y= ln x x 0 y 1 1 y=oe „ x y= ln x FIGURE 15 FIGURE 16 Inverse Trigonometric Functions When we try to ind the inverse trigonometric functions, we have a slight dificulty: Because the trigonometric functions are not one-to-one, they don’t have inverse func-tions. The dificulty is overcome by restricting the domains of these functions so that they become one-to-one. You can see from Figure 17 that the sine function y -sin x is not one-to-one (use the Horizontal Line Test). But the function f s x d -sin x , 2 H9266 y 2 < x < H9266 y 2, is one-to-one (see Figure 18). The inverse function of this restricted sine function f exists and is denoted by sin 2 1 or arcsin. It is called the inverse sine function or the arcsine function . y 0 _π π x π 2 y= sin x 0 y x _ π 2 π 2 FIGURE 18 y -sin x, 2 H9266 2 < x < H9266 2 FIGURE 17 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","64 CHAPTER 1 Functions and Models Since the deinition of an inverse function says that f 2 1 s x d -y &? f s y d -x we have sin 2 1 x -y &? sin y -x and 2 H9266 2 < y < H9266 2 Thus, if 2 1 < x < 1, sin 2 1 x is the number between 2 H9266 y 2 and H9266 y 2 whose sine is x . EXAMPLE 12 Evaluate (a) sin 2 1 s 1 2 d and (b) tan s arcsin 1 3 d . SOLUTION (a) We have sin 2 1 s 1 2 d -H9266 6 because sin s H9266 y 6 d -1 2 and H9266 y 6 lies between 2 H9266 y 2 and H9266 y 2. (b) Let H9258 -arcsin 1 3 , so sin H9258 -1 3 . Then we can draw a right triangle with angle H9258 as in Figure 19 and deduce from the Pythagorean Theorem that the third side has length s 9 2 1 -2 s 2 . This enables us to read from the triangle that tan s arcsin 1 3 d -tan H9258 -1 2 s 2 ■ The cancellation equations for inverse functions become, in this case, sin 2 1 s sin x d -x for 2 H9266 2 < x < H9266 2 sin s sin 2 1 x d -x for 2 1 < x < 1 The inverse sine function, sin 2 1 , has domain f 2 1, 1 g and range f 2 H9266 y 2, H9266 y 2 g , and its graph, shown in Figure 20, is obtained from that of the restricted sine function (Fig-ure 18) by relection about the line y -x . The inverse cosine function is handled similarly. The restricted cosine function f s x d -cos x , 0 < x < H9266 , is one-to-one (see Figure 21) and so it has an inverse function denoted by cos 2 1 or arccos. cos 2 1 x -y &? cos y -x and 0 < y < H9266 The cancellation equations are cos 2 1 s cos x d -x for 0 < x < H9266 cos s cos 2 1 x d -x for 2 1 < x < 1 sin 2 1 x ± 1 sin x 2 oe „ 2 3 ¨ 1 FIGURE 19 0 y x 1 _1 π 2 _ π 2 FIGURE 20 y -sin 2 1 x -arcsin x FIGURE 21 y -cos x , 0 < x < H9266 0 y x 1 π π 2 Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

","SECTION 1.5 Inverse Functions and Logarithms 65 The inverse cosine function, cos 2 1 , has domain f 2 1, 1 g and range f 0, H9266 g . Its graph is shown in Figure 22. The tangent function can be made one-to-one by restricting it to the interval s 2 H9266 y 2, H9266 y 2 d . Thus the inverse tangent function is deined as the inverse of the func-tion f s x d -tan x , 2 H9266 y 2 , x , H9266 y 2. (See Figure 23.)
